I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University. I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Missouri (2020). I have a BS in Wildlife Biology and Statistics from Colorado State University (2014). My research interests include statistics, alternative learning, spatiotemporal modeling, animal behavior, and ecological applications.
